## Todos
- Edit muscle anatomy diagram dimensions; the diagram is a stick
- Change heading for hypertrophy tips. Colours for hypertrophy heading make the word almost invisible.
- Some muscle groups have limited exercise options, especially for home workouts without equipment, eg QUADS - 1 Exercise: Bulgarian Split Squat. Bruh (Include eg squats with knees outside toes, lunges)
- Instructions for some exercises not clear, "elevated"? Beginners may not understand. Eg. Edit it to "elevated on a firm object eg a stool, bench"
    - biceps, forearms, upperChest, lowerChest, traps, abs, quads, upperBack, midBack, lowerBack, lats, glutes, hamstrings, calves

## IMPORTANT: How to update app version 
If you deploy to app store or play store, you must follow these steps: Edited code -> Create new build -> Submit for review -> App store review for a few days -> user gets the update notification

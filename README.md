# What is QuickFit?

QuickFit gives you personalised fitness workouts that can be accomplished anywhere, anytime. It doesn't matter how much time you have, what matters is whether you're putting consistent effort. Remember, discipline beats motivation, especially on those rainy days. 

## Todos
- Edit muscle anatomy diagram dimensions; the diagram is a stick
- Change heading for hypertrophy tips. Colours for hypertrophy heading make the word almost invisible.
- Some muscle groups have limited exercise options, especially for home workouts without equipment, eg QUADS - 1 Exercise: Bulgarian Split Squat. Bruh (Include eg squats, lunges)
- Instructions for some exercises not clear, "elevated"? Beginners may not understand. Eg. Edit it to "elevated on a firm object eg a stool, bench"
